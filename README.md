# Bonk Box

**Your agent. In a box. Bonk him.**

A tiny physics toy where a stickman lives on a page of your sketchbook. Flick
him about, launch fireworks at him, knock over the fort he built. He always
bounces back.

## Tell your agent to install it

> install bonk-box from github.com/eddiesanjuan/bonk-box

That is the whole thing. Your agent reads [`install.sh`](install.sh), drops the
app in `/Applications` and opens it. The joke writes itself: your agent installs
the toy you bonk it with.

Or, if you would rather do it yourself:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddiesanjuan/bonk-box/main/install.sh | bash
```

**Or just play it in a browser:** [bonk-box-production.up.railway.app](https://bonk-box-production.up.railway.app)

## Play it

Three ways, same toy:

- **On the web:** [bonk-box-production.up.railway.app](https://bonk-box-production.up.railway.app)
- **On your Mac:** a small always-on-top desktop app — see below
- **From this folder:** double-click `index.html`. That is the whole install.

Your coins, toys and streak live in your browser (or in the app), on your own
machine. Nothing is uploaded anywhere. The web version and the desktop app each
keep their own separate save.

No build step, no server, no npm. It runs straight from `file://` in any modern
browser. The only thing it fetches from the network is a Google font, and it
looks fine without one.

## How to play

Start with three toys and the 50 coins he hands you for showing up.

- **Hand** (1) — hover near him for a nudge; click and drag any limb to pick him
  up and fling him. This is the whole toy, really.
- **Feather** (2) — hold it over him and he giggles. Kindness pays as well as
  slapstick does.
- **Beach ball** (3) — press, drag back and release to sling it. Every
  throwable works this way, with a dotted arc showing where it will land.

Everything he does earns doodle-coins. Spend them in the shop (the **+** button)
on more toys — water balloon, trampoline, bundle of sticks, anvil, gust fan,
party popper, bowling ball, confetti, gravity flip, firework, piano — and on
hats and ink colours. The hard hat is not just a look: head bonks bounce off it
with a *ting* and leave 78% fewer scuffs.

Come back tomorrow and he hands you a little sack of coins — the buddy you
spend all day bonking pays your allowance. Keep coming back and the streak
unlocks things coins cannot buy: a paper crown at three days, a bubble wand at
a week, gold ink at a fortnight, and at thirty days a little sun that rises in
his room for him to lie under.

At the far end of the shop are four legendaries, priced to be a proper haul.
The golden anvil rains some of your coins back out when it lands. The star
shower fills the room with weather. The bottle rocket takes him for a lap. And
the most expensive thing in the game is a tiny friend who follows him about,
helps with the fort and high-fives him — you grind bonk-coins to buy him a
friend, which is the joke at the top of the ladder.

Buy the **bundle of sticks** and leave them lying about. When he is cheerful and
nothing else is going on, he will walk over, carry them back one at a time and
build himself a little fort, then draw a flag on it. Knock it down and see what
happens.

Other controls:

| Key | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `1`–`9`, `0` | Pick a tool from the tray |
| `R` | Fresh page (clears props, keeps your coins) |
| `M` | Mute |
| `Esc` | Close the shop |

Click his name tag to rename him. Coins, tools, hat, ink, name and mute all
persist in `localStorage`, and he says hello when you come back.

## What he does on his own

He balances actively: gentle muscle torques hold him upright, he breathes,
shifts his weight, and his eyes follow your cursor. Hit him hard enough and the
muscles switch off entirely — full ragdoll.

Once he settles he gets back up, and how he does it depends on how scuffed he
is. Barely marked, he kips up. Well scuffed, he pushes off the floor and climbs
to his feet in a wobble. Either way some of his limb strokes go smudged in the
fall, and they **redraw themselves tip-to-tail** as he rises, with a pencil
point riding the leading edge. That is the bit worth watching.

His mood drives his behaviour. Happy, he dances, waves and doodles hearts on the
floor. Grumpy, he sits down with his arms crossed and holds up small hand-written
protest signs. Cookies and confetti cheer him up and mend scuffs quickly; time
alone does it slowly.

## Layout

```
index.html            the page, classic <script> tags, no modules
css/style.css         the chrome: tray, shop, gauges, name tag
js/state.js           palette, tuning constants, save/load, economy
js/doodle.js          hand-drawn line primitives (wobble, ink, text, bubbles)
js/sound.js           WebAudio one-shots, synthesised, no audio files
js/particles.js       dust, confetti, splashes, eraser crumbs, coin tallies
js/buddy.js           ragdoll, muscles, poses, recovery  (no DOM — testable headless)
js/buddy-draw.js      drawing him: ink strokes, face, hats, the redraw signature
js/tools.js           tool catalogue, props, shop prices
js/fort.js            the fort: gathering, stacking, pride, and the sulk
js/companions.js      the rocket ride, the tiny friend, the daily gift, the sun
js/ui.js              tray, shop, gauges, keyboard
js/main.js            canvas, room, input, collisions, render loop
vendor/matter.min.js  matter-js 0.20.0, vendored
server.js             tiny zero-dependency static server, for hosting
install.sh            macOS installer
desktop/              Tauri v2 wrapper for the desktop app
test/physics-check.js headless feel-check (node test/physics-check.js)
```

## Checking the physics

The ragdoll is the product, so it has a test:

```bash
node test/physics-check.js
```

It steps the real `js/buddy.js` headless and asserts the things that decide
whether he feels right: does he stand unaided, do the joints stay together
through a hard fling, does energy run away, does the muscle blend ever snap,
does he survive twelve hard bonks in a row, and is a step cheap enough for
60fps. All sixteen checks should pass.

## Desktop app

A small window that floats above everything else, so he can potter about in the
corner of your screen while you work.

```bash
./install.sh
```

That drops **Bonk Box** in `/Applications` and opens it. Once it is running:

- **Option+Command+B** hides and summons him
- the menu-bar stickman has **Show / Hide** and **Quit**
- to uninstall, quit it and drag `Bonk Box` from `/Applications` to the Trash

To rebuild it from source after changing the toy:

```bash
cd desktop
npm install          # first time only
npm run build        # copies the web toy in, then compiles
```

`desktop/build-frontend.sh` copies `index.html`, `css/`, `js/` and `vendor/`
into `desktop/dist/`. The page at the repo root stays the single source of
truth — nothing under `desktop/dist/` is edited by hand.

The published build is **arm64 (Apple silicon)**. On an Intel Mac `install.sh`
falls back to building from source, which needs Rust and Node.

## For AI agents: installing Bonk Box

If someone asks you to install Bonk Box on their Mac, run this:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eddiesanjuan/bonk-box/main/install.sh | bash
```

Or, if you already have the repo cloned, `./install.sh` from inside it.

What it does: downloads the latest release, unpacks it to
`/Applications/Bonk Box.app`, clears the download quarantine flag (the build is
unsigned — it was compiled on a laptop, not signed by an Apple developer
account, so Gatekeeper would otherwise refuse to open it), and opens the app.
If there is no usable release asset for their machine it builds from source
instead, and tells you exactly what is missing if Rust or Node are not there.

What they get: a small always-on-top window with a stickman in it. He balances,
breathes, and watches the cursor. Drag him around by any limb and he ragdolls,
bounces off the walls and picks himself back up. Everything pays doodle-coins,
which buy more toys from the shop.

Tell them: **Option+Command+B** hides and summons the window, the menu-bar
stickman has Show / Hide and Quit, and uninstalling is dragging
`Bonk Box` from `/Applications` to the Trash.

If — and only if — they explicitly ask to wire him to their coding agent, clone
the repo and run `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`. Never do that step silently: it
edits their Claude Code settings (additively, with a backup, and there is a
matching uninstaller).

The repository is `github.com/eddiesanjuan/bonk-box`.

## Credits

Built as a homage. Interactive Buddy was made by Shock Value in 2005 — if you
have not played the original, play the original.

Physics by [matter-js](https://brm.io/matter-js/). Everything drawn at runtime
on a canvas; there are no image assets in this repository.

## Wire it to your agents

Optional, and entirely opt-in. Nothing installs this for you.

```bash
cd bonk-box && ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

That adds three Claude Code hooks, a `bonk` command, and a small stickman on
the end of your status line:

| When | What he does |
| --- | --- |
| Your prompt sounds rough | Holds up a sign: *"Do you want to f— this agent up?"* with two buttons |
| A tool call fails | Pops in wincing, holds the "shipping a fix..." sign |
| The reply says "absolutely right" | Says it too |
| You run `bonk` | Summons him. `npm test \|\| bonk` works anywhere |

He slides in from the edge **without taking your keyboard**, does his bit, and
slides back out after about eight seconds. Click him to engage properly. Taking
focus automatically is a config flag that is off by default.

### He lives in your status line too

The desktop box is lovely and you are not always looking at it. So the same
events put a stickman on the end of Claude Code's own status line, where you
already are:

```
Fable 5 [███░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 17% main* bonk-box  ᕦ(ᐛ)ᕤ 2·240
```

He stands about, winces when a tool call fails, braces when a prompt sounds
rough, and settles back to standing after a minute. The two numbers are the
heat tally: **today, then all time**.

**Your status line is not replaced.** The installer records whatever command
you already had, and ours runs yours first and prints its output untouched
before adding the stickman. If any part of ours goes wrong it prints your line
and nothing else — a toy is never a reason for your status line to break.
`scripts/uninstall-hooks.sh` puts your original setting back exactly, and a
timestamped backup of `settings.json` is written before anything changes.

Turn just the stickman off and keep everything else:

```json
{ "statusline": false }
```

This part reads one small file the hooks write — an event word and a timestamp
— plus the heat counts. No prompt text is involved in either.

Status line changes, like the hooks, **only apply to new Claude Code sessions.**

### `bonk`

| Command | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| `bonk` | An animation in your terminal, and the app reacts too |
| `bonk --app` | Just summons the desktop box, no animation |
| `bonk --quiet` | Sends the event and says nothing |

In a terminal you get about two seconds of him getting an anvil, a piano or a
firework dropped on him and getting back up, drawn on the alternate screen so
**your scrollback is untouched** — when it finishes, one line is added and
everything you had is where you left it. Ctrl-C puts the terminal back.

Piped or redirected, there is no animation: three static lines, so
`npm test || bonk` reads well in a build log. It is only ANSI, so it works over
SSH. `NO_COLOR` is respected everywhere.

### What actually leaves your machine

Nothing.

The word-matching happens inside the hook script, on your machine, in memory.
Your prompt text, your tool output and your file paths never leave that script.
The only thing that crosses localhost is one word from a fixed list of five:
`oops`, `cheer`, `heated`, `echo-absolutely-right`, `bonk`. Nothing is logged,
nothing is stored, and the app has no backend to send anything to.

The word list is [`hooks/heated-words.txt`](hooks/heated-words.txt) — plain
text, edit it however you like.

Settings live at `~/.config/bonk-box/config.json` (port, auto-focus, and how
often he is allowed to peek on his own).

**Hooks only apply to new Claude Code sessions.** Restart Claude Code after
installing.

To undo: `./scripts/uninstall-hooks.sh`. It removes only our entries and backs
up your settings first, same as the installer.

## He counts how often you get heated

Under the name tag there is a small pencil tally: how many times today, this
week, and since you installed him. It is the same word list the hook uses, so
"heated" means the same thing whether he noticed it live or found it later.

He never opens a window to tell you about it. The tally is only there when he
is already on screen for a reason you allowed, and occasionally he says
something dry about it while you are looking at him.

### Exactly what it reads, and exactly what it keeps

To have a number for the days before you installed him, he reads the coding
transcripts already on your machine:

| Source        | Directory read                   | On by default |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `claude-code` | `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl`  | yes           |
| `codex-cli`   | `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl`   | no            |

Only prompts **you typed** are counted. Tool output, injected context, messages
from other agents and your editor's own housekeeping prompts all wear the same
"user" label in those files and are all skipped.

Codex is off by default, and the reason is arithmetic rather than taste. Its
transcripts do not record where a prompt came from, and a fleet that dispatches
one instruction to fifty parallel sessions writes it into fifty files. Measured
on the machine this was built on: 454 matches from 110 distinct prompts, one of
them landing in 76 separate transcripts. Claude Code labels its prompts, and
the same measurement there was 221 matches from 217 distinct prompts. Counting
your agents' arguments as your own temper would make the number a lie.

**What is written to disk, in full:**

- `~/.config/bonk-box/heat/tally.json` — dates and counts. About a kilobyte.
- `~/.config/bonk-box/heat/cursor.json` — how far each file has been read, so
  it never reads the same bytes twice. Keyed by a hash of the path, so not even
  the paths are recorded.

No prompt text. No excerpts. No file names, project names or paths. The text is
matched in memory and dropped as the line is read. **Nothing leaves your
machine** — there is no network call in any of it, and still no backend to send
anything to.

One honest caveat about today's number: the live half of the count is whatever
the app was told, so anything that sends a `heated` event counts — including
you testing your own hooks. If you have been poking at the wiring, today reads
a little high. The scanned half only ever counts prompts that are really in
your transcripts.

It reads in short slices with long gaps and picks up where it left off, so a
first pass over a large history finishes quietly in the background over a few
minutes and after that there is almost nothing left to do.

### Turning it off

```json
{
  "heatTracking": false
}
```

Or leave it on and choose your sources:

```json
{
  "heatSources": [
    { "id": "claude-code", "enabled": true },
    { "id": "codex-cli", "enabled": true }
  ]
}
```

Turning it off stops the reading and the counting. To forget what it already
counted, delete `~/.config/bonk-box/heat/`.

## Updating

He checks once a day and tells you himself: a sign saying the new version is
out, with **update now** and **later**. "Update now" fetches the release, swaps
the app and relaunches. There is also **Check for Updates** in the menu-bar
menu. Any network trouble is a silent skip — he never nags and never blocks.

That updater carries the app and only the app. The hooks, the `bonk` command
and the status line live in this repo, so those come with `git pull` — re-run
`./scripts/install-hooks.sh` if you move the repo somewhere else.

Installs from before v0.4.0 have no in-app updater. Bridge them once with the
agent line, which works for any version:

> update bonk-box from github.com/eddiesanjuan/bonk-box

`install.sh` is the updater — it always fetches the newest release.

## When he shows up

By default he only appears for three things: **heated language in your prompt**,
**⌥⌘B**, and the **`bonk`** command. Everything else your agent does reaches him
quietly, and he reacts in a box you are not looking at.

When he does appear for an event it is a small box in the corner — him, his
sign, and nothing else. Click it and it opens into the full toy. Turn the quiet
ones back on per event in `~/.config/bonk-box/config.json`:

```json
{ "peekOn": { "oops": true, "cheer": true, "echo": true }, "peekCorner": "top-right" }
```

## Buy him a cookie

Bonk Box is free, and it stays free. There is nothing to unlock with money and
nothing to subscribe to — the only currency here is doodle-coins, and you get
those by bonking him.

If it made you laugh and you feel like buying him a cookie anyway, there will
be a link right here once we set one up. No pressure at all. He mends on his
own.
